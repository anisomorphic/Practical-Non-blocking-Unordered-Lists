Practical Non-blocking Unordered Lists
by Marcus Sooter and Michael Harris

Software Transactional Memory version of Lock-Free Linked List in Java
using DeuceSTM 1.2, credit to Guy Korland

Due to the potential difficulties involved with testing this package, and the integrated
compile time library deuce, provided as a jar, this version of the program is provided
both as raw source, and as a convenient NetBeans 8.2 project, provided as a .zip project file.

You can easily add deuce in the IDE of your choice by importing the .jar file provided
as a compile-time library, or by importing and running the provided .zip as a NetBeans project.

Please contact mmph87@Knights.ucf.edu for any support with the STM version of this List.
  
Verbose benchmarking is on by default and will display information on the terminal window.
